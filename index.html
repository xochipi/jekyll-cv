    I love all forms of entertainment: video games, board games, and role-playing games.
    I like studying game mechanics and creating new ones. I have made several Board games and I have many more in the pipeline. I love writing about adventures, settings, and characters.
    I take inspiration from what I see, hear or experience to create something new that I can share with the people around me.

Staying up-to-date is the basis of my job. My main tasks are studying new technologies, following recent trends, and modernizing everything that doesn't work anymore.
All my tasks make me versatile and willing to learn.
