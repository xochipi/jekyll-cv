    I love all forms of entertainment: video games, board games, role-playing games.
    I like to study the game mechanics and create new ones. I have made several Board games and I have many more in the pipeline. I love writing adventures, settings and characters.
    I take inspiration from what I see, hear or experience in order to create something new that I can share with the people around me.
